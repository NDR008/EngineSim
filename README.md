# EngineSim
A Matlab in-cylinder pressure combustion engine model

This was a university model, where I wanted to create a pragmatic engine model that could predict the in-cylinder pressure of an internal combustion based on:  
a) Physical parameters (broke/stroke/etc)
b) Fuel type (Gasoline/Diesel/Unique fuel)
c) Spark/Combustion ignition based

The model is a mix between physical and numerical modelling, but delivers a reasonably useful result.

It is missing exchange strokes of the cycle.
